# GOLD-ToolKit
To promote the applications of Gompertz law-based (GOLD) algorithm of biological age, we developed the R package 'GOLD-ToolKit' as an integration of these approaches.

# Algorithms
| Method | Data Requirements | Primary Function | Key Innovation |
|--------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
|**GOLD**| Longitudinal survival data | Estimate mortality hazard and biological age | Gompertz law application for mortality estimation |
|**GOLD-R**| Cross-sectional data | Estimate biological age residuals | Residual-based approach for cross-sectional studies |
|**GOLD-RL**| Longitudinal survival data | Estimate mortality hazard and age residuals | Combines hazard estimation with residual analysis |
|**GOLD-B**| Compatible with various data types | Update biological age residuals | Bayesian framework for residual refinement |
