\title{Calculate biological age using Gompertz model with feature selection}
\usage{
gold_bioage(
  d4,
  var,
  feature_selection = FALSE,
  selection_method = "lasso",
  alpha = 1,
  nfolds = 10,
  family = "cox"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d4}{Dataframe containing survival information (time, status)}

\item{var}{Character vector of variable names (must include 'age')}

\item{feature_selection}{Logical indicating whether to perform feature selection (default: FALSE)}

\item{selection_method}{Method for feature selection: "lasso", "elasticnet", or "none"}

\item{alpha}{Elasticnet mixing parameter (0 = ridge, 1 = lasso)}

\item{nfolds}{Number of folds for cross-validation}

\item{family}{Survival family for glmnet (default: "cox")}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item model1_coef: Coefficients from Model 1
  \item model2_coef: Coefficients from Model 2
  \item coefficients: Biological age coefficients
  \item Bioage: Dataframe with calculated biological age
  \item selected_vars: Variables selected by feature selection (if performed)
  \item cv_plot: Cross-validation plot (if feature selection performed)
}
}
\description{
Computes biological age based on two Gompertz regression models with optional
Cox-LASSO feature selection for biomarkers
}
\examples{
# Load dataset
data(NHANES4)

# Define variables
var <- c("age", "albumin", "alp", "creat", "glucose_mmol", "lymph", "mcv", "rdw", "wbc", "ggt")

# Without feature selection
result1 <- gold_bioage(NHANES4, var)

# With LASSO feature selection
result2 <- gold_bioage(NHANES4, var,
                      feature_selection = TRUE,
                      selection_method = "lasso")

# With Elasticnet feature selection
result3 <- gold_bioage(NHANES4, var,
                      feature_selection = TRUE,
                      selection_method = "elasticnet",
                      alpha = 0.5)
